# The frequency of possibilities for manipulation in participatory budgeting

This repository contains the code with which the results in our paper are obtained. To replicate the results for unit costs and theoretical distributions run
`python run_experiments.py --cost_max 2`
To replicate the results for varying costs for the theoretical distributions run:
`python run_experiments.py --cost_max 11`
To replicate the results for real-world distributions make run:
`python run_experiments.py --path 'path/to/data.pb`
